# üîß NOT FOUND - ISSUE FIXED!

## ‚ùå Issue: "Not Found" Error
The Azure Static Web App was pointing to wrong file in configuration.

## ‚úÖ Solution Applied:

### 1. Configuration Fixed
- **Problem:** `staticwebapp.config.json` pointed to `/portfolio.html`
- **Solution:** Updated to point to `/index.html`
- **Status:** Fixed and pushed to GitHub

### 2. New Deployment Triggered
- **Automatic rebuild:** Started after push
- **Expected time:** 2-3 minutes
- **GitHub Actions:** Check build progress

### 3. Alternative Access Methods

**Method 1: Direct File Access**
- Try: https://mlsa-portfolio.azurestaticapps.net/index.html
- Try: https://mlsa-portfolio.azurestaticapps.net/portfolio.html

**Method 2: GitHub Pages (Backup)**
- URL: https://si464434434.github.io/mlsa-portfolio/
- Status: Available as backup option

**Method 3: Local Development**
- File: `file:///C:/Users/Lenovo/OneDrive/Documents/hello/index.html`
- Status: Always working locally

### 4. Monitoring Links
- **GitHub Actions:** https://github.com/Si464434434/mlsa-portfolio/actions
- **Azure Portal:** https://portal.azure.com
- **Repository:** https://github.com/Si464434434/mlsa-portfolio

### üéØ Expected Resolution:
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Time:** 2-3 minutes for rebuild
- üåê **URL:** https://mlsa-portfolio.azurestaticapps.net
- ‚úÖ **Status:** Should work after rebuild completes

### üí° Why This Happened:
Azure Static Web Apps need correct file paths in configuration. The initial config pointed to `portfolio.html` but our main file is `index.html`.

### üöÄ Next Steps:
1. Wait for GitHub Actions build to complete
2. Refresh the website URL
3. If still issues, try direct file links above
4. Check build logs in GitHub Actions

**Fix Status: APPLIED ‚úÖ**
**Rebuild Status: IN PROGRESS ‚è≥**
